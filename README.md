- 👋 Hi, I’m @TurjoRahman, I am a passionate Computer Science student at the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), with a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its transformative potential. I enjoy working with a variety of AI learning algorithms, exploring their applications, and leveraging AI technologies to solve real-world problems while making my work more efficient.

My curiosity drives me to continuously learn and experiment with cutting-edge AI tools and frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenAI, to build innovative solutions. I am particularly fascinated by areas like machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision.

I believe in the power of AI to simplify complex tasks and enhance productivity, and I strive to integrate AI into my projects to create smarter, more efficient systems. Whether it's building intelligent chatbots, developing computer vision models, or automating repetitive tasks, I am always eager to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying updated with the latest advancements in AI by reading research papers, participating in online communities, and competing in AI challenges on platforms like Kaggle. My goal is to contribute to the AI field by developing impactful technologies that make a difference in people's lives.

- 👀 I’m interested in gym, coding and AI.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some small AI projects. I don't care what ever it is, i am mostly interested to learn new things.
